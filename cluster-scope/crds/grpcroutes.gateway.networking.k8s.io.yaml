        description: 'GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes
          the capability

          to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.

          Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify

          where matching requests will be routed.


          GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the

          following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation

          supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an

          implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement

          unless explicitly indicated.


          Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST

          accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e.
          via

          ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the

          "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason
          of

          "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections

          with an upgrade from HTTP/1.


          Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST

          support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,

          https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial

          upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge

          (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation

          does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"

          for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".

          Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from

          HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.'

                        other resources.

                        is

                        if at

                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example,
                        Gateway

                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by
                        Route kind,

                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept
                        attachment from

                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully

                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this
                        Route, the

                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are
                        specified and

                        how many are invalid.


                        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are
                        also no filters

                        this rule MUST

                        receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.

                        makes a single

                        GRPCBackendRef invalid.


                        When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, `UNAVAILABLE` statuses MUST
                        be returned for

                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid
                        backend. If

                        backend

                        MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.


                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights,
                        and one is

                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE`
