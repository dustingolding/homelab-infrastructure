                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to
                        other resources.

                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName
                        is

                        interpreted.


                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire
                        resource.

                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful
                        if at

                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example,
                        Gateway

                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by
                        Route kind,

                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept
                        attachment from

                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully

                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this
                        Route, the

                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        sent.


                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are
                        specified and

                        how many are invalid.


                        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are
                        also no filters

                        specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches
                        this rule MUST

                        receive a 500 status code.


                        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what
                        makes a single

                        HTTPBackendRef invalid.


                        When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be
                        returned for

                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid
                        backend. If

                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the
                        proportion of

                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid
                        backend

                        MUST receive a 500 status code.


                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights,
                        and one is

                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations
                        may

                        choose how that 50 percent is determined.


                        When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready
                        endpoints,

                        implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend
                        instead.

                        If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above
                        rules for 500 responses

                        MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                            in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                            When specified, a trailing `/` is

                                            ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`,
                                            `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all

                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path
                                            `/abcd` would not.


                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible

                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                      and `/abc/def` would all

                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd`
                                      would not.


                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a

                                      For example, a request

                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo"
                                      and a ReplacePrefixMatch

                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix
                                      match type. This

                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers

                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When
                                      specified, a trailing `/` is

                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                      and `/abc/def` would all

                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd`
                                      would not.


                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a
                                      `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.

                        sent.


                        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are
                        specified and

                        how many are invalid.


                        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are
                        also no filters

                        specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches
                        this rule MUST

                        receive a 500 status code.


                        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what
                        makes a single

                        HTTPBackendRef invalid.


                        When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be
                        returned for

                        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid
                        backend. If

                        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the
                        proportion of

                        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid
                        backend

                        MUST receive a 500 status code.


                        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights,
                        and one is

                        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations
                        may

                        choose how that 50 percent is determined.


                        When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready
                        endpoints,

                        implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend
                        instead.

                        If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above
                        rules for 500 responses

                        MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                            `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all

                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path
                                            `/abcd` would not.

                                      For example, a request

                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo"
                                      and a ReplacePrefixMatch

                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix
                                      match type. This

                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers

                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When
                                      specified, a trailing `/` is

                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                      and `/abc/def` would all

                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd`
                                      would not.


                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a
                                      `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
